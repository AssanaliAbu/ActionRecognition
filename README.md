# Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition
Training and evaluating DD-Net (1D CNN) and Transformer models on 2 different video datasets KTH and JHMDB. 
Used pose recognition tools : Mediapipe, HRNet.

Accieved accuracy: 93% (KTH), 85%(JHMDB). 

Also testing the Flower federated learning framework which allows to concurrently train a model using more than 1 device and share  weights between devices.
